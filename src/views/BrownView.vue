    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>
    <p>
      Brown is a brown bear. He has small, black eyes (just the same as Cony's), two tiny ears and a
      short tail, he never shows his emotions through his face.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality">Personality</span></h2>
    <p>
      Brown is silent, calm and quite a shy bear but when he gets furious, he will punish his
      friends in a way even more frightening than Cony. Although he sometimes fights with Cony, he
      is still a caring and gentle spouse of hers.
